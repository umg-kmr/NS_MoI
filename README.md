# NS_MoI
NS_MoI is a python code to solve the stellar structure equations for a slowly rotating Neutron Star. It gives the mass, radius, moment of inertia and the dimensionless tidal deformability parameter ($\Lambda$).

The main code is contained in the codes directory and is divided into two parts, driver has the methods to calculate the required quantities and the main module implements them with multiprocessor support.
